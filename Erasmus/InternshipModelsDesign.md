# Model Design

The Internship is a continuation of my research addressing the Object-Oriented Internet concept. A more in-depth description you may find at [Object Oriented Internet  GitHub repository](https://github.com/mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI#object-oriented-internet).

The Internship focus on selected topics related to Domain-Specific Languages, like validation, semantic diff, and conversion (translation). The work will be conducted against models gathered in the repository:

[UA-Nodeset](https://github.com/mpostol/UA-Nodeset)

I am expecting from you a contribution:

- to prepare and maintain the research environment
  - prepare scripts that allow automating the execution of existing command-line tools for the Windows operating system
  - using the prepared scripts and existing tools to convert models in the repository expressed in the UANodeSet to ModelDesign domain-specific language (detailed knowledge of the UANodeSet and ModelDesign language is not required)
  - using the prepared scripts and existing tools validate the models and report any errors if exist
- to manage the research results
  - create your fork of the repository `UA-Nodeset`
  - prepare appropriate scripts executing tools against all models gathered in the repository `UA-Nodeset`
  - pull request the results to the `UA-Nodeset` repository
- prepare a final description of the results
