### I have just published the last lecture recording and activity

Let me inform you that I have just published the last lecture outcomes. They are available in the section [Recordings 2021 Summer](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/course/view.php?id=224#section-3). This section contains a seminar recording and also a file with the corrected Q/A dialog on chat. Review the file and report your result using `Seminar activity` - each answer = 1 pts. Report your scores using comments. Your achievement must be reported before the next lecture.

I am pretty sure that I answered all the questions. Let me know in advance if there is something I have skipped.
