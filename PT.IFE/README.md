### Course summary

#### Self enrollment

To enroll use the key: `PT`. After enrolling, you must select a laboratory group.

#### Subject

Computer science in general, and especially programming activities, is a field of knowledge that deals with the automation of information processing. Programs can be recognized as a driving force of that automated behavior. To achieve information processing goals programs have to implement algorithms required by the application concerned. In other words, the programs describe how to process data, which represent information relevant to the application. Data management - apart from the implementation of the algorithms – is, therefore, a key issue for automation of the entire information processing and computer science in general.

Let's review selected language constructs, patterns, and frameworks targeting data-intensive programming.

#### Goal

The aim of the course is to extend knowledge and skills related to object-oriented programming focusing on interoperability between the computing process and data visualization, archiving, and networking environment. Particular emphasis is placed on the identification of solutions that can serve as a certain pattern with the widest possible use over a long-term horizon. Providing a long-term horizon is extremely difficult for such a dynamically developing field. Here, the experience of the author comes to the rescue, who has been employing similar solutions for years using constantly changing programming tools.

To ensure the practical context of the discussion and provide sound examples, all topics are illustrated using the C# language and the Visual Studio design environment. The source code used during the course is publicly available in a GitHub repository. I believe that the proposed principles, design patterns, and scenarios are generic and may be seamlessly ported to other environments. The language and tools mentioned above have been used only to embed the discussion in a particular environment and to ensure that the course is very practical.

The course discusses solutions for practical scenarios regarding various aspects of process data management, i.e. those that are input or output for the business logic of the program. In general, three classes of data have been distinguished:

- streaming (i.e. files, network packets)
- structural (i.e. databases)
- graphical: (i.e. Graphical User Interface)

### Self enrollment settings

#### Custom welcome message

Welcome to the Programming Technologies course! We are excited to have you as part of our membership. After enrolling, you must select a laboratory group.

### Task 1

#### UMLDiagram

#### CheckList

- Title:  Task 1 Check list
- Copy the content of the file to a new GitHub issue to get a list of tasks prefixed by checkboxes you can use to control the scope and progress of your work.

### GitHub README.md template file

Your repository must have the `README.md` file prepared according to this template. Place the README.md file in the main directory of the repository. A GUID is required for identification. This GUID can be generated using `VS \ Tools \ Create GUID`. Don't use example GUIDs embedded in the template.

#### Reservation module

- \<data\> Lab \04 Reservation

Please book a time-slot for # 4 laboratory using this module to check the progress of your work and compatibility of design environments. In the comment field, please enter the URL of your GitHub repository, which will be used to carry out the tasks included in the course program. In the same field, you should also put the GUIDs previously placed in the README.md file of the repository. The GUID can be generated using `VS \ Tools \ Create GUID`.

## WIKAMP enrolment invitation
