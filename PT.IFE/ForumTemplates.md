## Enrolment message on forum

Welcome to the Programming Technologies course!

We are excited to have you as part of our membership. After enrolling, you must select a group using the module [Laboratory group selection](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=11193)

The laboratory classes will be conducted using the Microsoft Teams platform. You must register to the  [21-Programming Technologies (PT) 2021 Summer](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a03bcf14941ef4c3aa956653bea3ce36b%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=29e0c6e8-23fe-4380-a8b4-499e3af79359&tenantId=67ea5955-9b5c-4693-a8f9-960f2a3b49bb). Register as soon as possible if you haven't already.

Unenroll from PT, and contact me immediately if you have been enrolled in this curse by mistake.

I am open to any questions or proposals you may have. Contact me on Teams or by email.

Good luck!!

### Forum

I have been asked by the University Authority to harmonize the schedule with the current situation, and especially the late enrolment of some course members. I agree with that so I decided to postpone the deadline for Task 1 from lesson 5 (10-11-2020) to lesson 6 (17-11-2020).

During the next laboratory, we will repeat the same agenda as for lesson 4, and as a result, you will have the opportunity to reserve a place in the line to validate your code against my environment and assessment rules. Again, it is your opportunity but not a requirement. Add to the code everything you believe is useful for you. In other words, everything is allowed but only a few things are required.  

**My advice is - keep things as simple as possible to avoid a surprise.**

Contact me directly in any case questions or proposals you may have.

## Task 1 Check list publication

As I did promise today I have just published the file `Task 1 Check list.md` to help you apply self-assessment. Copy the content of this file to a new GitHub issue to get a list of tasks prefixed by checkboxes. You can use them to control the scope and progress of your work. Add an issue like that before the final code assessment. 
BTW; let stress again. To accomplish Task 1 it is not required

- to use external data sources, as files, databases, etc.
- to use any additional framework (if someone can do something in the framework we can do it in code for sure).

Anyway, using any external stuff is not required but possible. There is only one rule: if you are using something additional you must be prepared to explain how it works. Let me stress all requirements and all topics on the checklist are invariable.

## Lab - Alternative Path

Referring to my promise regarding the possibility of implementing a more ambitious project, instead of task 2, I have a question:

Is there anyone willing to follow the alternative path to pass the lab?

I will ask for information as soon as possible because the task needs to be prepared in advance. The project must be carried out in three stages.

Contact me by email or on the Teams platform.

## I have just published the last lecture recording and activity

Let me inform you that I have just published the last lecture outcomes. They are available in the section [Recordings 2021 Summer](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/course/view.php?id=224#section-3). This section contains lecture recordings and also files with the corrected Q/A dialog on chat. This time I have left more answers associated with one question, but your activity for this lecture shall not be considered to report activity points. Take it easy. The next ones will be more serious.

### NOTE

1. The list contains just acceptable answers. Most of them are not suitable to pass the final test. The list reflects your activity but not the correctness of your answers.
1. During your workout assessment, you will have to prove that something is true without any doubts using only terms defined by the programming language (usually any programming language).
1. Sometimes I may be wrong, so if you believe that your answer was correct but has been removed from the list don't hesitate and schedule a meeting with me to get more and review your answers.

### How to improve your correctness

1. Use only terms defined by the language (usually any programming language), e.g. set of methods/statements versus set of functionality, program execution versus computation, etc.
2. Use an unambiguous ("measurable" ) description that allows the creation of a condition to distinguish if something is true or not, e.g. how to distinguish if two items are tightly or loosely coupled.
3. Take care to distinguish the software life cycles, i.e. talk about classes in the context of software development, talk about objects (instances of the classes) in the context of program execution.

## Lab Time Slot Reservation

I would like to invite you to a remote Laboratory class as part of the course **Programming Technologies**. Laboratory classes are conducted on the Teams platform.

Please book a time-slot for the classes using the appropriate module `Lab 04 Reservation`. Our goal is to check the progress of your work and the compatibility of the design environments. In the comment field, please enter the URL of your GitHub repository, which will be used to carry out the tasks included in the course program. In the same field, you should also put the GUIDs previously placed in the README.md file of the repository. The GUID can be generated using `VS\Tools\Create GUID`.

Let me stress, your repository must have the `README.md` file prepared according to the template `GitHub README.md template file` published on WIKAMP. Place the README.md file in the main directory of the repository. A GUID is required for identification. This GUID can be generated using `VS\Tools\Create GUID`. Don't use example GUIDs embedded in the template.

## Repository Creation Task

According to the curse rules all group members have to use the personal GitHub repository to share the source code. One repository per working group (a pair) is expected but **each course participant must complete this task**. The task evaluation doesn't contribute to the final course grade. Read carefully the description of the task [Create Repository](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/mod/assign/view.php?id=20097). The description contains a link to a video recorded already to provide a basic introduction. Submit the task as soon as possible.

- **NOTE: It doesn't contribute to the final curse grade but failure to report the completion of the task up to the 6th week of classes is considered a resignation from completing the course**.

## Activity points final summary

It was the last opportunity to gather activity points. Provide the total in the online text window using the following template:

`Total= <scores>`

and submit the task as soon as possible but not later than Sunday, 27 June 2021, 12:00 AM.

## Final grades

Hi All,

We are approaching the end of the semester so it is time to finalize your grading process. I have just updated the grades so I will appreciate checking your reports up to **dd-mm-yy**.

Let me recall that there is the seminar example code. Have a look at
