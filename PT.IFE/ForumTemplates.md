## Enrolment

### Invitation

Welcome to the Programming Technologies course!

We are excited to have you as part of our membership. After enrolling, you must select a group using the module [Laboratory group selection](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=11193)

The laboratory classes will be conducted using the Microsoft Teams platform. You must register to the  [21-Programming Technologies (PT) 2021 Summer](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a03bcf14941ef4c3aa956653bea3ce36b%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=29e0c6e8-23fe-4380-a8b4-499e3af79359&tenantId=67ea5955-9b5c-4693-a8f9-960f2a3b49bb). Register as soon as possible if you haven't already.

Unenroll from PT, and contact me immediately if you have been enrolled in this curse by mistake.

I am open to any questions or proposals you may have. Contact me on Teams or by email.

Good luck!!

### Late enrolment

ü§ùüèªHello,

It is possible to enroll in the course as an Erasmus student, but it is late enrolment and probably needs an individual schedule. To enroll follow the procedure

1. Read carefully about scope, goal, and rules of assessment before making a final decision. Access to the course landing page is open for guests [Programming Technologies](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/course/view.php?id=224).
1. After login into the WIKAMP enroll in the course at [Programming Technologies](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/course/view.php?id=224). The key to enrolling is PT.
1. You must also enroll to the our team on MS Teams. Instruction hot to get starred is at the top of landing page of the course.
1. Read carefully the documents provided on this page and join the appropriate project group using the module Laboratory group selection. You may advertise your willingness to find someone to make a team using the entry on Teams at: [Pairs selection](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:AUB8jKBn0SgWb7LuqrHCc6otW_wehGEOQ9F80Bpt1uU1@thread.tacv2/1646841286339?tenantId=67ea5955-9b5c-4693-a8f9-960f2a3b49bb&groupId=671706ef-d5ee-40b7-8bdb-0346cf339d2a&parentMessageId=1646841286339&teamName=22-Programming%20Technologies&channelName=General&createdTime=1646841286339).
1. It is possible to adjust deadlines for you in advance - send me a proposal to follow up provided you need to modify them, otherwise let me keep them intact. It must be done in advance.
1. Please join the current team on Teams: 22-Programming. Instruction is at the top of the course working space.
1. You must accomplish the task 0 ‚Äì read carefully assessment rules. Again, because of your late enrollment I can consider your proposal to change the schedule for you, but I must get your proposal ASAP.

In case of problem or questions, you may have I can organize a consultancy meeting üòä on Teams.

Good luck and keep me informed.

### Late enrollment schedule change

I have been asked by the University Authority to harmonize the schedule with the current situation, and especially the late enrolment of some course members. I agree with that so I decided to postpone the deadline for Task 1 from lesson 5 (10-11-2020) to lesson 6 (17-11-2020).

During the next laboratory, we will repeat the same agenda as for lesson 4, and as a result, you will have the opportunity to reserve a place in the line to validate your code against my environment and assessment rules. Again, it is your opportunity but not a requirement. Add to the code everything you believe is useful for you. In other words, everything is allowed but only a few things are required.  

**My advice is - keep things as simple as possible to avoid a surprise.**

Contact me directly in any case questions or proposals you may have.

## Lab announcements

### Task 0 Check list Create Repository

According to the curse rules all group members have to use the personal GitHub repository to share the source code. One repository per working group (a pair) is expected but **each course participant must complete this task**. The task evaluation doesn't contribute to the final course grade. Read carefully the description of the task [Create Repository](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/mod/assign/view.php?id=20097). The description contains a link to a video recorded already to provide a basic introduction. Submit the task as soon as possible.

- **!NOTE: It doesn't contribute to the final curse grade but failure to report the completion of the task up to the 6th week of classes is considered a resignation from completing the course**.

### Task 1 Check list publication

As I did promise today I have just published the file `Task 1 Check list.md` to help you apply self-assessment. Copy the content of this file to a new GitHub issue to get a list of tasks prefixed by checkboxes. You can use them to control the scope and progress of your work. Add an issue like that before the final code assessment.
BTW; let stress again. To accomplish Task 1 it is not required

- to use external data sources, as files, databases, etc.
- to use any additional framework (if someone can do something in the framework we can do it in code for sure).

Anyway, using any external stuff is not required but possible. There is only one rule: if you are using something additional you must be prepared to explain how it works. Let me stress all requirements and all topics on the checklist are invariable.

### Lab - Alternative Path

Referring to my promise regarding the possibility of implementing a more ambitious project, instead of task 2, I have a question:

Is there anyone willing to follow the alternative path to pass the lab?

I will ask for information as soon as possible because the task needs to be prepared in advance. The project must be carried out in three stages.

Contact me by email or on the Teams platform.

### I have just published reviewed last seminar chat activity (Q/A)

Let me inform you that I have just published the last lecture outcomes. This time I have left more answers associated with one question, but your activity for this lecture shall not be considered to report activity points. Take it easy. The next ones will be more serious.

#### Note

1. The list contains just acceptable answers. Most of them are not suitable to pass the final test. The list reflects your activity but not the correctness of your answers.
1. During your workout assessment, you will have to prove that something is true without any doubts using only terms defined by the programming language (usually any programming language).
1. Sometimes I may be wrong, so if you believe that your answer was correct but has been removed from the list don't hesitate and schedule a meeting with me to get more and review your answers.

#### How to improve your correctness

1. Use only terms defined by the language (usually any programming language), e.g. set of methods/statements versus set of functionality, program execution versus computation, etc.
2. Use an unambiguous ("measurable" ) description that allows the creation of a condition to distinguish if something is true or not, e.g. how to distinguish if two items are tightly or loosely coupled.
3. Take care to distinguish the software life cycles, i.e. talk about classes in the context of software development, talk about objects (instances of the classes) in the context of program execution.

### Project Grading Process - Additional Explanation

From the emails, I have got, it seems to me that the topic is not clear for all of you, so again. Grading is possible only during regular lessons (lessons in timetable). Consultancy as the name says is to consult your problems, but not for grading your work. I would like to recall you that submission for grading is recognized as a declaration of finishing prototyping and readiness to defend your solution in front of the lab group. Therefore the submission data must be letter then last modification in your repository for the selected tag. In case you need to improve the code after submission you must ask me by email to revert the submission to the working status (that allows modifications of your submission) and another attempt. The sequence of grading is determined by the submission date - first submissions are first graded - it is like a FIFO scenario.

Because we are using tags as a snapshot of submitted for grading work there is no need to wait for grading to commence work on the next task. I expect that the work is conducted simultaneously if needed. In other words, the late grading is not an excuse to postpone the submission of the next task.

Following the goal of the classes, I am using the grading process to explain in practice selected topics covered by the course scope focusing on the abstract problems but embedded in the concrete development. Sometimes it takes time to get your correct answers to prove that you understand it. I try to organize the discussion around the published checklist but details are in the detailed description of the lab tasks. Let me stress: to pass ALL REQUIREMENTS MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED. It doesn't mean that I am able to check all requirements and point out all problems. If you know about any inconsistency with the requirements in your program based on the discussion you are obliged to ask me for reverting your submission to fix the problem in advance, but first, prove using the checklist that everything is as expected before submitting it for grading. It will give you an additional opportunity to present your solutions in front of the group. I would like also to engage all of you to ask questions to the team presenting the solution in concern.

Good luck

### Lab Time Slot Reservation

I would like to invite you to a remote Laboratory class as part of the course **Programming Technologies**. Laboratory classes are conducted on the Teams platform.

Please book a time-slot for the classes using the appropriate module `Lab 04 Reservation`. Our goal is to check the progress of your work and the compatibility of the design environments. In the comment field, please enter the URL of your GitHub repository, which will be used to carry out the tasks included in the course program. In the same field, you should also put the GUIDs previously placed in the README.md file of the repository. The GUID can be generated using `VS\Tools\Create GUID`.

Let me stress, your repository must have the `README.md` file prepared according to the template `GitHub README.md template file` published on WIKAMP. Place the README.md file in the main directory of the repository. A GUID is required for identification. This GUID can be generated using `VS\Tools\Create GUID`. Don't use example GUIDs embedded in the template.

## Final grades

### Seminar activity submit the task

**Submit the activity scores**:

Please sum your activity tickets (scores collected during the seminar or as a result of the TP repository modification), and provide the total in the online text window using the following template:

```txt

Total= <scores>

```

and submit the task

### Test invitation

Referring to my previous verbal announcement I want to confirm the test schedule:

- 20.06.2023 10:30 - room 106/CTI

It will be a WIKAMP (modle) an online test using only computers available in the lab. A Modle test refers to an online assessment or examination conducted through the Modle learning management system (LMS). The test will be conducted only in English. In any case, you have only 3 attempts for the final test.

Let me recall that there is an example code. Have a look at [mpostol/tp](https://github.com/mpostol/TP)

I will review the most essential topics in the next seminar lesson. Join me and give me feedback in advance - I am a willing helper to explain once more the vital issues for you if possible. To work alone,  you may also check out not published yet the course

- [Programming in Practice - Information Computation (not published);2023](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC7zPvgw-Ybwya54i262_RfG5tEp2FSIt).

There is also a helpful video book but only in Polish.

- [C# language In practice. Video Course. External Data Processing](https://videopoint.pl/kurs/jezyk-c-w-praktyce-kurs-video-przetwarzanie-danych-zewnetrznych-mariusz-postol,vjcprv.htm#format/w)

Good luck and stay in touch.

#### Possibility of retaking the test

Remember that according to the [Assessment ‚Äì grading scale](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/mod/page/view.php?id=11195), you have three test attempts, which don't depend on your current scores. The next attempts will be conducted remotely. You must be a member of the _24-Programming Technologies_ Teams group. Information on how to enroll can be found on the WIkam landing page. If you are going to make the next test attempt let me know by email and send your preferences regarding the date and time for when the test will be opened next time. I am waiting for your proposal up to the end of this week, i.e. up to **06-09-2028**. My proposal is **17-09-2028 at 10:15**. It will be the last attempt this year. The proposal applies to students who have not resigned from the possibility of improving grades and asked me to transfer their current grades. A final decision will be sent on Monday 09-09-2024.

Stay in touch.

### Additional opportunity to earn points for activity

I would like to remind you that one of the components of the final grade is the scores obtained for the activity - details in the "Assessment ‚Äì grading scale". Typically,  there are two forms of activity, namely:

1. answers to questions during the seminar
2. active contribution in creating examples for the course

Due to the upcoming end of the semester, the activity described in (1) will soon be unavailable. The possibility of earning points for the activities described in item 2 will be available until August 21, 2022. Additionally, during this edition of the course  you can also get up to 20 activity points for your contribution to the following projects:

- [.NET application portability using containerization](https://tulodz.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/22-ProgrammingTechnologies/Shared%20Documents/General/AppPortabilityContainerization.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=TIwyyB)
- [.NET standard deliverables portability using cloud services](https://tulodz.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/22-ProgrammingTechnologies/Shared%20Documents/General/AppPortabilityWebApp.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=8ttq1S)

Check out the documents listed above to get details. This opportunity is only available to students who have already passed (are graded) the project. Each project can only be assigned to one person, regardless of the course (projects are also offered in my other courses) - ask about availability and book ASAP.

### I have just published the last seminar activity

Let me inform you that I have just published the last seminar outcomes. Review the file and report your result using `Seminar activity` - each answer = 1 pts. Report your scores using comments. Your achievements must be reported before the next lesson.

It was the last opportunity to gather activity points during the seminar. Provide the total in the online text window using the following template:

`Total= <scores>`

and submit the task as soon as possible but no later than Sunday, 03 July 2022.

### Final grades published on WIKAMP

Hi All,

We are approaching the end of the semester, so it is time to finalize your grading process. I have just updated the grades, so I would appreciate checking your results as soon as possible.

Remember that according to the [Assessment ‚Äì grading scale](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/mod/page/view.php?id=11195), you have three test attempts, which don't depend on your current scores. The next attempts will be conducted remotely. You must be a member of the _24-Programming Technologies_ Teams group. Information on how to enroll can be found on the WIkamp landing page. The attempt is optional. Hence, if you want to make the next test attempt you must let me know by email and send your preferences regarding the date and time for when the test will be opened next time. I am waiting for your proposal up to the end of this week, i.e. up to **06-09-2028**. My proposal is **17-09-2028 at 10:15**. It will be the last attempt this academic year. The proposal applies to students who have not resigned from the possibility of improving grades and asked me to transfer their current grades. A final decision will be sent on Monday **09-09-2024**.

Let me recall that the final grade for the test is calculated as the average of all attempt scores, so it is possible to decrease and increase the final result.  Anyway, you are welcome to participate once more.

After the test, I will generate the final report, and any modification of the grades will be almost impossible.

Again, let me recall that there is the seminar example code. Have a look at

- [https://github.com/mpostol/TP](https://github.com/mpostol/TP)

To be in touch please start watching the repository.

### The end of the semester is approaching

Hello Students,

We are approaching the end of the semester so it is time to finalize your grading process. I have updated the grades so I would appreciate checking your results. Let me stress that the Summer assessment period will continue from **09.09.2024‚Äì to 18.09.2024**, after that, your final grades will be transferred to "Webdzikanat". I am not sure if there is an English name for this logbook. The "Webdzikanat" is the official repository of your grades. I transfer all grades after the assessment period according to the [Academic year calendar](https://p.lodz.pl/en/students/academic-year-calendar). The same link you have on the WIKAMP landing page for the course. If there are any complaints about your grade inform me about it ASAP. If you want to retake the test to improve your grade send me your proposal in advance before the beginning of the assessment period.

If you need your grade to be transferred to "Webdziekanat" earlier before the assessment period is finished further modification of your grade will be not practical or impossible. Therefore, to trigger the transfer I need more explanations on "why/deadline" and a declaration as follows

```txt
I am satisfied with my grade on the WIKAMP platform. I have no complaints about my grade and will not have any in the future. I will not request to improve my grade in the future. I want my grade to be transferred to the webdziekanat system and I will not have any complaints about it.
```

Again, let me recall that there is an example code. Have a look at

- [https://github.com/mpostol/TP](https://github.com/mpostol/TP)

To be in touch please start watching the repository. Additionally, I have started publishing a video course. Check out the most interesting for you from my profile:
