# Schedule during examination periods

Let me inform you about the optional classes dates:

| Title             | Date            | Time       | Registration module                   |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| _________________ | _______________ | __________ | _____________________________________ |
| Lecture test      |                 |            |                                       |
| Project assesment |                 |            |                                       |

The schedule is a proposal and may be modified if needed. I will appreciate your informing me about any date conflicts you may encounter or any outstanding work that should be graded. All classes are conducted on [TEAMS][TEAMS].

The lecture evaluation is conducted as a test on [WIKAMP][quiz]. The access password will be provided at the beginning of the lesson conducted on [TEAMS][TEAMS]. The test resolution time is limited to 20 minutes. All dates are optional. You have **three attempts** to improve your scores. The final grade is the average of all attempts. Before any attempt, you must mark your willingness to participate using the appropriate reservation module. After booking your approach is obligatory (you cannot resign).

The test will be conducted only in English.

Let me recall that there is an example code. Have a look at [mpostol/tp](https://github.com/mpostol/TP).

There is also a helpful video book but only in Polish: [C# language In practice. Video Course. External Data Processing; in polish](https://videopoint.pl/kurs/jezyk-c-w-praktyce-kurs-video-przetwarzanie-danych-zewnetrznych-mariusz-postol,vjcprv.htm#format/w)

Good luck
