### Seminar activity (Task)

Report your activity points using [Seminar activity](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/mod/assign/view.php?id=10883) - each ticket = 1 pts. Report your scores using comments of the mentioned module. Your achievement must be reported ASAP.

Use the syntax `Lesson XX Scores= YY Tickets = {tttt, }`, where

- `XX`   lesson number,
- `YY`   number of points you reported for this lesson.
- `tttt` ticket number

Entry for each lesson should be in the new comment.

In case you got activity points as a result of the TP repository modification report your activity points using the following syntax `Pull Request ppp Scores= YY` , where

- `ppp` is the Pull Request number

After opening the module please sum your activity points (scores collected during the seminar), and provide the total in the online text window using the following template:

```txt

Total= <scores>

```

and submit the task.

### Project deadlines and scores

| Task Name          |         Deadline week number          |     Scores      |
| ------------------ | :-----------------------------------: | :-------------: |
| __________________ | _____________________________________ | _______________ |
| Projekt Task 0     |                   4                   |     4, 3, 2     |
| Projekt Task 1     |                   7                   |  18, 15, 12, 9  |
| Projekt Task 2     |                  11                   |  18, 15, 12, 9  |
|                    |                                       | _______________ |
| Total              |                                       |      <= 40      |

**Notes**:

- Task completion must be **reported by 24:00 on the day before** the deadline. To report completion:
  - Create a release in the corresponding GitHub repository.
  - Press the submit button for the appropriate task.
  - **Each team member has to report the readiness for evaluation separately**.

> **Important**: Make sure your submission is not left as a draft, as draft submissions do not count as submitted. Tasks in the draft version will not be treated as effectively reported!

- **Late reporting reduces the maximum score for the task, with deductions applied for each week of delay for the team as a whole. Each member of the working group must report separately that the task is ready for evaluation**
- the date for the week number is determined based on the official University timetable
- If the task was reported on time but you didn't manage to pass, **as a result of your fault**, the max score for the task would still be decreased accordingly (see the table above).

### Project group selection (group selection)

All participants must be a member of one laboratory group. Use this module to select the group you prefer. Take care that we will work in pairs and all members of the working team must be in the same group. You can change your selection provided there are free seats in the destination group. The number of members is limited.
