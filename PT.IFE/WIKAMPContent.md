### Seminar activity Assignment (Task)

**Submit the activity scores**:

Please sum your activity tickets (scores collected during the seminar), and provide the total in the online text window using the following template:

```txt

Total= <scores>

```

and submit the task.

### Seminar Activity Q/A (Files folder)

- Seminar activity files containing questions and accepted answers
- `\date\ Lesson xx \<title\>.xlsx`

### Activity scores reporting (page)

Review the files above and report your result using [Seminar activity](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/mod/assign/view.php?id=10883) - each answer I have not removed = 1 pts. Report your scores using comments of the mentioned module. Your achievement must be reported ASAP. Use the syntax `Lesson XX Scores= YY`, where

- `XX` lesson number,
- `YY` number of points you are going to report for this lesson (your answers in the appropriate file).

Entry for each lesson should be in the new comment.

### Project deadlines and scores

| Task Name          |         Deadline week number          |     Scores      |
| ------------------ | :-----------------------------------: | :-------------: |
| __________________ | _____________________________________ | _______________ |
| Projekt Task 0     |                   4                   |     4, 3, 2     |
| Projekt Task 1     |                   7                   |  18, 15, 12, 9  |
| Projekt Task 2     |                  11                   |  18, 15, 12, 9  |
|                    |                                       | _______________ |
| Total              |                                       |      <= 40      |

**Notes**:

- The task completion must be **reported up to 24:00 the day before**. To report completion you must create a release in the GitHub repository and press the submit button of the appropriate task. **Each team member has to report the readiness for evaluation separately**.
- the date for the week number is determined based on the official University timetable: [Calendar odd/even weeks for the 23/24 Summer Semester](https://ife.edu.p.lodz.pl/pluginfile.php/78638/mod_resource/content/9/Calendar%202024%20summer%20%28evenodd%20days%20pl%29.pdf)
- **Late report decreases the max score on the week number basis. Each working group member reports separately that the task is ready for evaluation.**
- tasks in the draft version will not be treated as effectively reported

### Project group selection (group selection)

All participants must be a member of one laboratory group. Use this module to select the group you prefer. Take care that we will work in pairs and all members of the working team must be in the same group. You can change your selection provided there are free seats in the destination group. The number of members is limited.
