# Introduction

According to the curse rules all group members have to use the repository to share the source code. To get an account in the Subversion repository (on the heart.ics.p.lodz.pl server), send the formatted text according to the syntax defined below containing the parameters for the script creating the account. Enter the text in the reply field for this module.

Please report your request as follows: Name Surname

> `login:hash:groupId:Name Surname:e-mail`

* `login`: is the proposed username, e.g. student index number. The login may contain only lower case letters of the ASCII alphabet: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`, numbers:` 0123456789`, and an underscore character: `_`.

> **Note!**: `login` must not contain `.` (dot character) as a result of the control panel limitation.

* `hash` is the hash of the password that allows access to the repository.

> **Note**: to generate your password hash, you should use the service [password generator](http://serce.ics.p.lodz.pl/site/genpass).
 
* `groupId`: ID for the team. You can work in pairs or alone. This identifier will be used as the name of the directory containing the source code of the team.
