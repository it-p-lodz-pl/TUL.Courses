# Task `Create Repository`

According to the curse rules all group members have to use the personal GitHub repository to share the source code.  Each course participant must complete this task, but its evaluation doesn't contribute to the final course grade. Before submitting for evaluation you should:

- create a GitHub repository together with your partner - one repository per working group is expected
- copy the contents of the file `GitHubREADMETempllate.md` to the file `README.md` of the repository
- complete the file by entering your personal identification (full name or initials) data and generate GUIDs
- the repository should contain a sample program that can be compiled
- unit tests that can be executed and passe should be included in the program
- copy the repository URL (green button) and your GUID into the text of `Feedback comment` of the task

## NOTE: failure to report the completion of the task up to the 6th week of classes is considered a resignation from completing the course

The repository creation process may be managed using a set of tasks you can find in the attached file `GitHubCreateRepoCheckList.md`.  Copy the text to a new issue to get started.

I did create a video with instructions on how to create a GitHub repository for the project - check it out in case you are not familiar with GitHub.
