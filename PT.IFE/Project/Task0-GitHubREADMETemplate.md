# Task0 GitHub README Template

Your repository must have the `README.md` file prepared according to this template. Place the README.md file in the repository's main directory. A GUID is required for identification. This GUID can be generated using `VS\Tools\Create GUID` or any online GUID/UUID generator. Don't use example GUIDs embedded in the template. In other words, the embedded GUID in the template must be replaced by a generated one.
