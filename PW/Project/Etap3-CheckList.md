# Project Stage 3 Checklist

- [ ] **Starting point**
  - [ ] all UT are green
  - [ ] the program behaves as expected (intermediate approval test)
- [ ] **Data Layer**
  - [ ] responsibility of this layer is
    - [ ] to represent boundaries of the movement rectangle if necessary
    - [ ] implement balls behavior as self-contained independent entities
    - [ ] save diagnostic data to a file
  - [ ] protect balls velocity against any influence from other balls and the environment behavior
  - [ ] balls implementation uses parallel programming if applicable (depends on the run time platform)
  - [ ] prove that the diagnostic logging doesn't have impact on the balls behavior
- [ ] **Logic Layer**
  - [ ] responsibility of this layer is to manage movement rectangle boundaries and balls interaction (collisions)
  - [ ] prove that the protection of data (balls position on abstract table during collisions detection) integration is implemented
  - [ ] `Logic` uses only the abstract `Data` layer API
- [ ] **Presentation Layer (mvvm)**
  - [ ] responsibility of this layer is to manage the graphical user interface (GUI)
  - [ ] user => GUI interoperability must be implemented using interactive programming only
  - [ ] GUI => the user interoperability must be implemented using reactive programming only (timer is not allowed)
  - [ ] interoperability of the GUI and underlying layers must be synchronized
  - [ ] prove that the protection of data (balls position on the screen) integration is implemented
- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Unit Test - layers are tested independently using dependency injection (additional framework is not required)
  - [ ] Mock may be used for testing purpose (expected but not required)
